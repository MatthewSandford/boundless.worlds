# Contributing to the Boundless World Builder

Thanks for taking the time to help out with the Boundless World Builder!

You can contribute in various ways; whether you're a master world builder, or just have a cool idea for a new biome, we greatly appreciate the help.  The following is a set of guidelines and common ways of helping out.

## Ideas

Have an idea for a new biome?  Or maybe an idea for making an existing config better?  Great!

First, take a look through [the existing ideas](https://github.com/turbulenz/boundless.worlds/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aidea).  Maybe someone beat you to it (curses!); no worries if so, you should definitely common on the existing idea!  The more movement we get on an idea, the better it will be, and the more likely someone will try their hand at making it real.

Or, if you don't see it, post it [via the issue tracker](https://github.com/turbulenz/boundless.worlds/issues/new).  Bonus points if you include images!

## Issues

Having trouble using one of the configs?  Not to worry; [file an issue](https://github.com/turbulenz/boundless.worlds/issues/new) describing what you're running into.  Please be as detailed as possible, and include any configs you might have that show the problem.

Protip: you can quickly upload/paste config files via https://gist.github.com/, and link to them in the issue.

## Contributing a new config

Fantastic; we love configs!  Please submit your config(s) as a pull request, and provide some detail about how they work.

If you're unfamiliar with git and/or GitHub, take a look at [the official guide on pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).  Don't be afraid to ask questions on [the forums](https://forum.playboundless.com/c/modding), too!

If possible, paste in some screenshots to give people a better idea.  Also, describe any of the parameters that they expose.

Bonus points if you add docs for the config(s) (take a look at [the existing docs](./docs) for examples).

## Making changes to an existing config

Just like a new config, feel free to create a pull request with your changes to existing configs.  Describe what you're changing about the config(s), and provide some background if it's useful.

Don't forget screenshots; and if it's relevant, try to update the docs for the configs that changed, too!
